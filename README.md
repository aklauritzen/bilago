# Bila{go}
Software to apply annex- and page number to pdf-files.

## Description
Bilago creates a copy of your existing pdf- and word files and applies annex- and page number to all pages. The original files remain untouched.
The new files are deliveres to a folder called “Bilageret date”.
You can choose a folder with subfolders, and Bilago will then process all files recursively.

## Define annex number
Annex number is defined by adding braces { } to the filename. The content between the braces is going to be the annex number. 

### Example
{4-01-1} – Report.pdf would add 4-01-1 at the top of all pages in the specified file.
